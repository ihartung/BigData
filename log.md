#### Report
Computed k using three different methods
All three methods of determining k returned 3
We computed variation and correlation
Clustered using k-means

Methods used to find k will work with high dimensions

Clustering, feature selection is implicit or explicit?

normal clustering divides the matrix by rows
e.g. row 1-10 is in cluster 1, row 11-20 in cluster 2

should be done simultaneously rows and columns

make this conclusion: which data set has the highest value? lowest value? how would you make this conclusion?
make qualitative conclusions on each cluster - which one has the highest values?

Is variation a better determinant of value?
What is the value of variation? of correlation? Is variation > correlation?

#### Next Steps
Report on what we've done

How much do we value variation? correlation? How are we going to determine that?

Hierarchical clustering

### Discussion
Is variation > correlation?
Probably.

Variance is susceptible to outliers

High correlation might have mean there is high collinearity

Can there be high cor and high var?
Seems like that won't be possible

Ranking: (we think)
1. +Var, -cor
2. -Var, -cor
3. -Var, +cor

#### Questions
1. When two or more datasets are scored, do the scores hold relative to each other?

#### Goals
1. Upload all datasets to Github
2. Rankings + Intuitive rankings
3. Report draft
